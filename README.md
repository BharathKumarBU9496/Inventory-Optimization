1. AVG Car Price by Year (Line Chart)
Purpose: Shows the trend of average car prices over the years from 1990 to around 2022.
Insight: There is a clear upward trend in car prices over the years, indicating inflation, changes in consumer preferences, or introductions of more expensive car models over time. The sharp increase around 2010 could suggest market changes such as new tax regulations, increased import costs, or a shift towards more luxury cars.
2. Cars by Year (Histogram)
Purpose: Displays the distribution of the number of cars sold per year.
Insight: The histogram shows a peak around 2015, suggesting that car sales were highest during this period. This could correlate with economic factors, promotional strategies, or consumer confidence.
3. AVG Car Price by City (Line Chart)
Purpose: Compares the average car prices across various cities.
Insight: There's significant variation in average car prices among different cities. For example, Delhi and Hyderabad show higher average prices, possibly indicating a preference for higher-end models or differing tax rates. The peak for Delhi in recent years could point to an increased market for luxury or new technology cars.
4. Car Brands by City (Stacked Bar Chart)
Purpose: Shows the distribution of different car brands sold in each city.
Insight: This chart provides a clear visual of which car brands are more popular in specific cities. For instance, cities like Mumbai and Delhi might show a diverse range of brands, indicating a variety in consumer preference and economic capacity. The dominance of certain colors in the stack can indicate a market leader in that region.
5. Fuel Type Distribution (Pie Chart)
Purpose: Displays the market share of different fuel types.
Insight: Diesel cars make up more than half of the market, indicating a preference for diesel vehicles, perhaps due to cost-efficiency or longer travel ranges. Petrol follows, and hybrids plus alternative fuels like CNG have a very small share, suggesting possible barriers such as higher costs or lack of infrastructure.
